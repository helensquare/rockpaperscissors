Rock, Paper, Scissorts Game

Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors game! This little project is part of my Python learning journey.
I'm currently enrolled in an online course where we tackle various projects every day, and this was one of them.

This game was initially designed to be played in the terminal, as we hadn't yet learned to use Streamlit or any other modules beyond the random module.
That's why some solutions might seem a bit weird. However, I could not wait to start using other modules and decided to seize this oportunity to create a frontend app for my game with Streamlit.

To play the game, just visit:

I hope you enjoy it! 🪨📃✂️
